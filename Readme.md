# ReadME Generator


## Description


The goal of this project was to use node in order to facilitate the creation of ReadME files for future projects both quickly and accurately. I was able to practice my javascript along with node in order to create a series of questions to be answered, once the answers have been collected the information will be placed into a ReadME file that is generated by javascript function. My biggest struggle was getting the badge licenses to work properly and show up in the generated readme file. I was able to get some guidance from a learning assistant who pointed me in the right direction to study so I may accomplish my goals. Luckily when we went over the mini project last week we were able to learn the basis for the code that is currently used in this project.
